            <h3>Trends in US Car Crash deaths</h3>
            <p>The data shows a significant upward trend in car crash deaths over the years. Here are some key observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early 1900s:</strong> The number of car crashes was relatively low due to the lower number of vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-20th Century:</strong> A significant increase in car crashes was observed as car ownership became more common.</li>
                <li><strong>Recent Years:</strong> Improved car safety and regulations have led to a decrease in fatalities per 100 million VMT.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Factors Contributing to Car Crashes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Driver Behavior:</strong> Speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Factors:</strong> Mechanical failures, tire blowouts, and other vehicular issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Weather conditions, road conditions, and lighting.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Something to note:</h3>
                <li><strong>I've included on my graph the average United States Population by year since 1950 (around when they truely began keeping records).
                    I did this to show that the trend actually, if you look at it compared to the population increase, is going down. If you look at the graph,
                it would be either parrelel or intersecting if numbers were truely going up. But instead they are going down. Just something to add before you begin
            to denounce technology and cars as a whole. Standardized car safety does work! </strong></li>
