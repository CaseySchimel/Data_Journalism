      <h2>Method and Response to Comments:</h2>
      <p>My protoype was not finished when it was time to compare and give feedback to eachother in class. So I decided to show them to my grandmother and get her opinion:
        Most of her comments regarded everything being very confusing(to be fair she doesn't know how to use an iphone). Anyway, regardless of her not reading 
        the book on the proper format of graphs and data sets, she made me aware of the fact that everything needed to be way less crowded. Everything was 
        all jumbled up and hard to follow. To impliment this, I took out as many unessesary and confusing things as possible. Such as certain graph axis that realisticlaly
        added nothing to the infographic and overall readability.
