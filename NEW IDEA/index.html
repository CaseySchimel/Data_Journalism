        <p>
            For my advanced computer science class, I was tasked with creating an infographic on a particular data set of interest. Originally I had the idea of doing the most common car brands by state, but that wasnt super interesting to me. I did more research and eventually decided to do amount of car crashes over the years vs the increase in population in the United States. I still managed to incorporate the most common car brands by state into this project; by usuing this as my state specific data. 
            When researching the most common car brands by state, I found many interesting facts. For example, I found that in California, the Tesla Model Y is the most common car, with the second being the Tesla Model 3. Ain't that neat!
